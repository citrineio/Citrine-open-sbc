# Ethernet Interface
RK3328 features an embedded 10/100 Mbit PHY interface. It also has a 1000/100/10 Mbit RGMII interface. The difference is that the RGMII interface requires an ethernet PHY IC to interface it with the ethernet connector. The current choice is to utilize the embedded 100 Mbit interface to reduce BOM cost. The board might be upgraded to support 1 Gbit ethernet in future iterations. 

## Ethernet Connector: 

The board will have [SI-50154-F](https://belfuse.com/product/part-details?partn=SI-50154-F "SI-50154-F") Bel Magnetic Solutions RJ45 connector. This connector has embedded magnetics and two LED connectors.
