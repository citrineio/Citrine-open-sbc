## Component Selection and Datasheets Rules:

 1. The component's datasheet must be available to the public via the manufacturer's or the supplier's website. NDA components are not acceptable. Leaked datasheets are not acceptable either.
 2. The component must be available in low volumes. Being available in suppliers such as Digikey and Mouser are highly preferable.
 3. If the suggested component is a replacement for the one already included in the design then please state the advantages (price, integration, reliability, size...etc)
