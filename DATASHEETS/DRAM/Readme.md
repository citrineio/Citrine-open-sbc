# DDR4 DRAM
The board will have two [MT40A512M16LY-062E IT:E TR](https://www.micron.com/products/dram/ddr4-sdram/part-catalog/mt40a512m16ly-062e "MT40A512M16LY-062E IT:E TR") (16 bit 8Gb) chips for the 2GB version and two [MT40A1G16RC-062E IT:B](https://www.micron.com/products/dram/ddr4-sdram/part-catalog/mt40a1g16rc-062e-it "MT40A1G16RC-062E IT:B") (16 bit 16Gb) for the 4GB version. The DRAM chip was chosen due to the publicly available datasheet. A design guide is also publicly available. 

## Other Options to Consider:

- Using two DDR3L chips.
- Using an available LPDDR3 chip.
