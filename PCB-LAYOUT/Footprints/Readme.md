# Footrprint Rules

The footprint must be based on either the recommended land pattern in the component's datasheet or the IPC 7351B standard. Footprints available on websites such as Snapeda can be acceptable given that they are throughly reviewed.

**Footprint Naming Format:** FP - [Datasheet File Name] - V[x]

Where x is the version.
