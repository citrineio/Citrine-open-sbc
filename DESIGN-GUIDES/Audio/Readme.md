There are two choices for audio: 

- Use the embedded analog output audio channels. This option means that headphone mics are not supported. Add a digital mic on the PCB and utilize the PDM interface.
- Use a cirrus DAC/ADC IC with Mic support and connect it to one of the I2S channels on the processor.
