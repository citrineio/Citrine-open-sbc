# RK3328
The processor that will be used is Rockchip RK3328. It was selected due to the availability of its datasheet, the price and the features it comes with. Unfortunately, the only available design guide is a reference schematics file. 

Design guides written based on your experience are always welcome. You can access more processor information in [Here](http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_RK3328 "Here")
