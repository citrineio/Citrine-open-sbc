# Open-sbc
The purpose of this project is facilitate the design of an open source single board computer. Kicad will be used to ensure that this SBC is as open source and accessible as possible. This project is meant as a learning experience or a reference design for anyone venturing into this beautiful field. 

## How do you benenfit from this project?

### Individual:
As an individual, there are many benefits you could benefit from this project:

- You have a design that you can study and learn from to improve your electronics design skills.
- Utilize the available design guides as a learning source.
- Because this project is open source, you can copy the design, modify it and add your own touch as per the license. 
### Company/Organization:
Organizations can also reap great benefits from having available open source hardware designs:

- Being an open source project, you can integrate this design into your products to shorten the time to market and ease the design process as per the license.
- Utilize the design or the repository as part of a tutorial for your employees.

## Specs:
The SBC shall have the following specs: 

- Rockchip RK3328 microprocessor
- 2/4GB of DDR4 RAM
- 16/32GB of eMMC
- MicroSD card slot
- 4 USB A connectors: 2 USB 2.0 and 2 USB 3.0
- Micro USB OTG connecter
- One HDMI connector
- 3.5mm jack for headphones
- 10/100 Mbit ethernet connector
- Wifi/Bluetooth module
- 5V/3A USB-C Power connector
- GPIO Pins: I2C, SPI, UART, I2C...etc

## Repository Guide:

### 3D:

3D model of the PCB, 3D models of the components are also available in the dedicated folder.

### Datasheets:

This is where you can access the datasheets of the major components used in the design. The readme file contains the rules for suggesting components and uploading datasheets. 

Suggesting components and ensuring that the uploaded datasheets are up to date will be a big help for us.

### Design Guides: 

This is where you can access the design guides for the major components used in this design. The files will be grouped  by feature (DRAM, HDMI, USB2.0...etc). You can find the rules of uploading design files in the readme file. You are welcome to write your own design guide based on experience or best practices of your job.

### Enclosure: 

PCB enclosure for the final design. 


### PCB Layout: 

The latest Kicad PCB layout file is here. We appreciate you tuning the traces especially the high speed ones. You can find component land patterns (aka footprints) in the dedicated folder.

### Schematics:

The latest Kicad schematics capture files are here. They are divided into pages based on features for easy readability. PDF version will be updated weekly during the schematics capture phase. You can also find the schematics symbols in the dedicated folder. 

### Software:

The OS that will be available in the SBC. We are aiming for a debian based linux distribution with a lightweight desktop environment. Other operating systems are very welcome.
